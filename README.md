The vanillaTree.js script is a lightweight yet versatile tool designed for creating and managing tree structures in web applications. 

Key features of vanillaTree.js:

- It supports both flat and nested tree structures
  
- It's ready to operate with hardcoded or server-fetched data
  
- The config is simple and comes with easy instructions. It can be set for different modes, such as checkbox and icon displays, and manage how selections affect node relationships
  
- It also switches the theme automatically due to OS dark/light theme (vanillaTree.css). Also, it's animated, and remains sharp when zooming.

There's even a ready-made Go server files (main.go + go.mod) to demonstrate its usage. 

Note that the Go server is just an example, meaning you're free to use any server you want.

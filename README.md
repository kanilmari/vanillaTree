Works with or without a server

The vanillaTree.js script is a lightweight yet versatile tool designed for creating and managing tree structures in web applications in pure JS. 

- Quick start: Download the whole project and open index.html in a browser. Enjoy testing it.

Key features of vanillaTree.js:

- It supports both flat and nested tree structures, both from server or from JS
  
- All the config is in the beginning of vanillaTree.js, and comes with easy instructions. It can be set for different modes, such as checkbox and icon displays, and manage how checkbox selections affect marking relative nodes.
  
- It also switches the theme automatically due to OS dark/light theme (vanillaTree.css). Also, it's animated, and remains sharp when zooming.

There's even a ready-made Go server files (main.go + go.mod) to demonstrate its usage in the main folder. You can use any server like Go, PHP, Java, Python, etc..

The vanillaTree.js script is a lightweight yet versatile tool designed for creating and managing tree structures in web applications. 

Key features of vanillaTree.js:

- It supports both flat and nested tree structures
  
- It's ready to operate with hardcoded or server-fetched data
  
- Users can set the config to different modes, such as checkbox and icon displays, and manage how selections affect node relationships
  
- It supports also dark and light OS theme switching by default (style.css). Also, it's animated, and remains sharp when zooming.

There's even a ready-made Go server to demonstrate its usage. Note that it's just an example, and you're free to use any server you want. :)

Works with or without a server

The vanillaTree.js script is a lightweight tool designed for creating and managing tree structures in web applications in pure JS. 

Key features of vanillaTree.js:

- It supports both flat and nested tree structures, both from server or from JS
  
- All the config is in the beginning of the main file "vanillaTree.js", and comes with easy instructions. It can be set for different modes, such as checkbox and icon displays, and manage how checkbox selections affect marking relative nodes.
  
- It also switches the theme automatically due to OS dark/light theme (vanillaTree.css). Also, it's animated, and remains sharp when zooming.

There're even ready-made Go server files (main.go + go.mod) to give you a full demo with server side. If you don't have Go, you can connect it to any server like PHP, Java, Python, or equivalent.
